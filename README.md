- 👋 Hi, I’m @markmitrani!
- 🎓 Currently studying at VU Amsterdam for a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Cognitive Science.
- 🎓 Graduated from TU Delft with a BSc (Honors) in Computer Science, with a minor in Responsible Innovation.
- 📌 Highlights from my projects:
  - 🌍 Concurrent Heatwave Prediction: Python codebase for preprocessing KNMI-LENTIS climate data, performing Archetypal Analysis, and training Earthformer, a spatiotemporal transformer for Earth systems forecasting.
  - 🎹 Music Theory Charts: A TypeScript-based [webapp](https://markmitrani.github.io/MusicTheoryCharts/index.html) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for visualizing musical scales on the piano.
  - 🧪 Creative Coding: Visual experiments in Processing and JavaScript + canvas-sketch.
  - 🧠 Deep Learning Coursework: Assignments from the DL course at VU Amsterdam, e,g building neural networks and implementing backpropagation from scratch and a PyTorch-based VAE implementation.
  - 📖 Phonemes & Readability: Code (python, nltk) used to drive the data exploration/analysis of my bachelor thesis (Investigating the Use of Phonemes in Readability Assessment).
